## ABSTRACT

This study presents a rigorous comparative analysis of embedding systems for information retrieval tasks, specifically comparing FAISS with sentence-transformers against the novel tidyllm-sentence-transformer architecture. Using standard information retrieval evaluation metrics on a computer science dataset, we demonstrate that educational, transparent embedding systems can achieve competitive performance while providing significant computational advantages. Our findings show that tidyllm-sentence-transformer achieves 65.5% Mean Average Precision (MAP) compared to 84.1% for pre-trained systems, while using 177x less memory and maintaining perfect precision at rank 1.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

The rapid advancement of neural embedding systems has led to significant improvements in information retrieval tasks. However, these systems often operate as "black boxes," limiting their educational value and interpretability. This study addresses the research question: **Can educational, transparent embedding systems compete with state-of-the-art pre-trained models in information retrieval tasks?**

We compare two fundamentally different approaches:
1. **FAISS + sentence-transformers**: Industry standard using pre-trained models with optimized indexing
2. **tidyllm-sentence-transformer**: Novel pure-Python architecture emphasizing educational transparency

## 2. METHODOLOGY

### 2.1 Experimental Design

We employed a controlled experimental design using standard information retrieval evaluation protocols:

- **Dataset**: Computer Science academic corpus (10 queries, 32 documents, 50 relevance judgments)
- **Metrics**: Precision@K (K=1,5,10), Recall@10, Mean Average Precision (MAP), NDCG@10
- **Hardware**: Standardized testing environment with controlled memory monitoring
- **Reproducibility**: All algorithms implemented with fixed random seeds

### 2.2 System Architectures

#### 2.2.1 FAISS + sentence-transformers (Baseline)
- **Model**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (pre-trained on 1B+ sentence pairs)
- **Dimensions**: 384
- **Indexing**: FAISS IndexFlatIP with L2 normalization
- **Search**: Optimized approximate nearest neighbor

#### 2.2.2 tidyllm-sentence-transformer (Proposed)
- **Architecture**: TF-IDF + Multi-head Self-Attention
- **Training**: Unsupervised on target corpus only
- **Dimensions**: Variable (corpus vocabulary size)
- **Search**: Direct cosine similarity computation
- **Implementation**: Pure Python, zero external ML dependencies

### 2.3 Evaluation Pipeline

```
1. Corpus Preprocessing → Tokenization → Vocabulary Building
2. Embedding Generation → L2 Normalization
3. Index Construction (FAISS only)
4. Query Processing → Top-K Retrieval
5. Metric Computation → Statistical Analysis
```
